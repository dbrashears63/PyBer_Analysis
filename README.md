#  PyBer Ridesharing Analysis Report

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a summary analysis of all the rideshare data from January 2019 to May 2019 by city type. The types of cities reviewed were urban, suburban, and rural. The metrics provided in this analysis will address any disparities among the city types and how best to provide resources and support to grow the company. 

## Resources
This study was conducted using software packages Python Version 3.10.7; Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12. The city_data.csv and ride_data.csv were provided by Omar the manager of the project.  
  
## Results
The key metrics reviewed were Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver.

In Fig. #1 it shows that Urban cities type has the largest number of rides and drivers, and Rural city type has the least. The Urban city type brings the most revenue and Rural city type brings in the least amount of revenue. This is backed up by the information contained in the Total Fares column.

When the average fare per ride is reviewed the Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride. The Urban city type has the lowest average fare per ride. The possibly reason why the Rural city type driver makes more on average per ride is because of the length and distance of the ride. The Urban city type driver makes less per ride for the same reason. Although the Urban city type driver makes less per ride, they overall make more money due to the volume of rides. 
The chart below provides a quick look to see how each city type performs and where the resources of the company might be best suited.

## Summary and Recommendations
Urban city type has the highest total of fares and the largest ridership; therefore this city type produces the largest amount of revenue for the company. As a result, this is the best performing city type. Investments in this city type could potentially provide the company with greater profits.
Rural city type has the least total of fares and the lowest ridership. Although this city type has the lowest ridership and total fare per ride for the driver it is recommend that a survey be done to see if an increase in ridership and drives would potentially provide a larger revenue stream for the company.
The Suburban city type sits in the middle of earnings, ridership and the number of drivers. This would indicate that the best use of the company resources would be in the Urban and Rural city types. 
This analysis is only based on 5 months of data for a single year. The type of analysis performed in this report would be better suited if the data set was over multiple years and additional metrics such as weather, traffic, etc. This would provide a richer analysis for the company to decide which city type and what type of resources would improve revenue and profitability.
